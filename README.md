<h1 align="left">Hi Everyone ðŸ‘‹, I'm Yong Sin</h1>

## Data Engineer 
I took a leap of faith to quit my previous job as a project engineer, and decided to be change I want to be. I took a 9 weeks intensive bootcamp by Le Wagon, and now I am an aspiring data scientist. I do believe with my current skillset coupled with my past knowledge, I'll be giving a greater impact to our society! 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™ve just finished a currently learning Microsoft Azure Data Factory usage and application for Data Engineer.

- ðŸ“« Please do not hesitate to contact me **yongsin91@hotmail.com** if there's anything that we could discuss on.

## Completed Project  
[Fightdet - Autonomous Violence Detection Model](../../../../Chewgithub/Fightdet)  
- This study is inspired by the works of Cheng, Ming (Github) and Cai, Kunjing and Li, Ming's work in RWF-2000: An Open Large Scale Video Database in 2019. Further exploration based on their study is conducted by testing on several different models, with different channels and optimizers. The goal of this project is to build a feasible model and deploy it into production.  
- This model is designed intentionally to help out for flagging violence activity in CCTV. It is able to reach **84% accuracy** with **5 second processing time**.  
- The sample model website can be accessed through this link ([Fightdet Sample Interface](https://fightdet-app-gf34ldcmyq-de.a.run.app/))

[NYC Taxi Fare Prediction Challenge](https://github.com/yongsin91/TaxiFareModel)  
- This project is an attempt to build a complete package on predicting the New York Taxi Fare (inclusive of tolls), based on the [Kaggle Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/new-york-city-taxi-fare-prediction). This is a playground competition, hosted in partnership with Google Cloud and Coursera. While basic estimate based on just the distance between the two points will result in an RMSE of $5-$8, depending on the model used.  
- This model is able to predict New York City Taxi Fare with an **RMSE of 4.64**, which is better than the **benchmark 5.74**.  
- The sample model website can be accessed through this link ([NYC Taxi Prediction Interface](https://taxifare-yongsin91.herokuapp.com/))

[Olist Ecommerce Platform Analysis](https://github.com/yongsin91/olist)  
- This study is to analyse the public data given by Olist in [Kaggle Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce) to give further ideas on improving their profit. 
- After accounting the IT cost and negative cost associated by the negative reviews, we can filter out **1004 sellers** that are actually under-performing and causing Olist to lose their profit
- Suggestion to remove under-performing sellers that are more than 5 months on the platform will **increase their profit by around 54.62%**
- Suggestion to monitor **under-performing sellers that are around 5 months on less** on the platform. They comprises **80%** of all under-performing sellers yet only contributes to **18%** of the loss. Olist can decide ways to provide help to those sellers for these newcomers to gain traction on the Olist Platform.
